**Description:** This project demonstrates that I have learned how to use command-line code to create/update repositories at github and then deploy these to a server. It also introduces me to the teaching team.

**Details for teaching team:**  
My customized CSS is in the project folder: css/app.css; this validates via WC3 standards.  
The CSS that is part of Zurb Foundation 5 framework does not validate; here is Zurb's explanation regarding the validation issues: [http://zurb.com/article/1260/we-ve-moved-beyond-code-validators](http://zurb.com/article/1260/we-ve-moved-beyond-code-validators)
